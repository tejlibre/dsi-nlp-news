    "We chose to create an app that provides an overview of one week of current twitter data. We chose to focus on tweets from Kenya, but this can easily be customised for another country or region. Our app is aimed at individuals working in the media industry who would like to supplement information gained from traditional media sources with information about currently treading topics on social media. In this way they would be able to better tailor their content to topics that are currently popular or trending. Our app also provides information on the sentiment and subjectively of the tweets as well as a text generation component that is intended to be used to provide background information or introduction. We have also allowed the user to adjust the date range so that they can analysis tweeter data, for example, on a specific date or over a weekend."

    "A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents. During this project we chose to apply a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. LDA topic modelling discovers topics that are hidden (latent) in a set of text documents. It does this by inferring possible topics based on the words in the documents using a generative probabilistic model and Dirichlet distributions. The number of topics is chosen in advance by the user and can be varied using a slider in our deployed app. \n",

This app was created using Streamlit and deployed on the cloud using the free serve provided by Streamlit. Below is a detailed summary of the conclusion made for each aspect of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment & Emotion Analysis\n",
    "- Alot of tweets had sentiment analysis scores of neutral. A possible explanation is lamguage barrier. Most probably the transformer and lexicon models had a hard time understanding non-english words.\n",
    "- The emotinal analysis was successfully done using both the Hugging Face transformer Model and the NRC lexicon model.\n",
    "- In our case transformers had a wider range of emotions (28 classes) in comparison to lexicon based (8 classes) and may be preferred for futher analysis or model deployment.\n",
    "- Lexicon based models are super fast in the emotion detection task in comparison to transformers. \n",
    "- With more time, it will be interesting to train transformer model on custom data for both the sentiment and emotion analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling\n",
    "-\tLDA with initialization of 3 topics had commendable results with less overlap between topics.\n",
    "-\tFurther analysis was also carried out to optimize the model.\n",
    "-\tGiven time we would have considered other algorithms such as Non-Negative matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Generation\n",
    "-\tBoth transformer model and LSTM model had promising results.\n",
    "-\tWe opted for GPT2 rather than GPT3 due to application response speed. GPT3 performs better than GPT2 but is larger in size and takes longer to load.\n",
    "-\tAn interesting area to pursue given more time is to train transformer model on custom data.\n",
    "- Training the LSTM model for more epochs also looks promising for output improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tStreamlit is easy to use, and free online deployment is very useful.\n",
    "-\tCustomisation is somewhat limited.\n",
    "-\tThere are difficulties in resizing pyLDAvis plot.\n",
    "-\tSetting a default colour scheme is important to ensure that all plots and text are clearly visible. \n"
